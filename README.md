Point Cloud / Volumetric Video Player for Unity
=============================================

**Point Cloud Player (PCP)** is a tool for reading & playing series of .PLY files as point clouds / volumetric videos. It can import .PLY files on-the-fly from `Local/Remote/StreamingAssets` sources and display through the native particle system.

PCP uses [keijiro/Pcx](https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx) under the hood.
